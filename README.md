# blender_output-coordinates
**coordinates.py** can output the coordinates of selected vertices in order in blender.  
Run the code, it will create a folder and a .txt file. When you select many vertices with **SHIFT**, the coordinates of the vertices will output in the .txt file. The order in which the coordinates are arranged is the order in which you select the vertices.
