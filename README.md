# blender_output-coordinates
This code can output the coordinates of selected vertices in order in blender.  
Run the code, it will create a folder and a .txt file. When you select many vertices with **SHIFT**, the coordinates of the vertices will output in the .txt file. The order in which the coordinates are arranged is the order in which you select the vertices.  
There is an example file to show what it outputs looks like.
